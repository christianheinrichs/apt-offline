apt-offline-python3
===================
This is apt-offline ported to Python 3.

I tested this modification very roughly and at the moment it seems to work, except a few parameters.  
Much testing is to be done yet and you should only use this program when you know what you are doing.

All credit goes to the [developers](https://github.com/rickysarraf/apt-offline/graphs/contributors), as this is their work.

**Run this program at your own risk. It is unstable and not tested enough.**
