apt-offline-python3-dev
=======================
This is apt-offline ported to Python 3.

Much testing is to be done yet and you should only use this program when you know what you are doing.

Credit goes to [Ritesh Raj Sarraf](https://github.com/rickysarraf) for creating apt-offline, [Manish Sinha](https://github.com/manish) and [Abhishek Mishra](https://github.com/ideamonk) for creating the apt-offline GUI,  
Chris Lawrence for writing several scripts (debianbts.py, reportbug_exceptions.py, urlutils.py), Jason Petrone for magic.py,  
[Kunal P.Bharati](https://github.com/kunal) for getting the GUI to work,  Steven J. Bethard for argparse, and to [Y Giridhar Appaji Nag](https://github.com/appaji) for modifications to apt-offline's manpage.

**Run this program at your own risk. It is unstable and not tested enough.**
